<h2>The Forms tool and the Resources tool</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following information is intended for CIG 
coordinators.</p>

<p>CIG Coordinators can create and publish forms for use in the
site. Each form is based on an <code>.xml</code> schema definition
(<code>.xsd</code> file). The <code>.xsd</code> file is usually
created offline and later added to Resources, from which it can be
added to the Forms tool.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> We strongly recommend that you store all
<code>.xsd</code> files in <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a> Resources rather than in the
portfolio site's Resources area. Site participants do not need to work
with or see these files. By storing <code>.xsd</code> files in your
personal Resources area (preferably in a folder named <code>Form
XSDs</code> or something similar), you prevent site participants from
possibly being confused by them. This practice leaves the site
Resources area free to be used as the place for files that are
appropriate for all site participants. It also allows you to use a
single copy of an <code>.xsd</code> file in your My Workspace
Resources to create forms in all of your sites.  Alternatively, you
may hide the <code>.xsd</code> files in a portfolio site's Resources,
as single files or in a hidden folder (using <strong><code>Edit Details</code></strong> in
the <strong><code>Actions</code></strong> drop-down menu).  For more, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=avbw">Working with folders in Resources</a> or <a href="content.hlp?docId=avby">Working with files in Resources</a>.</p>


<p>Using the Forms tool, you add <code>.xsd</code> files from Resources,
give them meaningful names, provide instructions for using them,
create the forms, and publish them for use by site participants. You
may also use the Forms tool to export forms from one site and import
them into another.</p>

<p>The Forms tool does not provide direct access to the forms you
create. Instead, site participants access forms that they need to
complete via the Matrices, Wizards, and Portfolio tools. In addition,
they may create, view, and edit form instances in Resources.</p>
