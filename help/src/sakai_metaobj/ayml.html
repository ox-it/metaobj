<h2>Adding and managing forms</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Typically, CIG coordinators perform the
actions described below.</p>

<h3>Preliminary steps</h3>


<p>Before adding a form:</p>

<ol><li>Create, or find, the XSD file that defines the data structure
you want. Review existing global forms on your instance. You may find
a form that suits your purposes, in which case you do not need to
create a new one. You cannot create an XSD file in the Forms tool; to
create an XSD file, use an offline XML editor or the Form Builder
(Contrib) tool.  <br /><br />
</li><li>When creating or editing an XSD file, plan the content
carefully. Keep the following points in mind:
<br /><br />

<ul><li>Field names are displayed to the left of the text fields to which
they apply.
</li><li>Field names wrap somewhat unpredictably.
</li><li>Long field names are difficult for participants to read.</li></ul><br />
</li><li>Consider adding the new form to the Forms tool in a test site in
order to view and change it as needed before including it in your
production site.</li></ol>

<h3>Adding a form</h3>

<p>To add a form, within the Forms tool:</p>

<ol><li>If you have not already done so, upload the XSD file (as well as
any alternate renders for the XSD) to Resources; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=avby">Working with files in Resources</a>.  <br /><br />
</li><li>In the site where you wish to add the form, open the Forms tool.
<br /><br />
</li><li>If you are not already on the Manage Forms screen, click the reset
button ( <div class="inlineimage image"><img class="noborder" src="image/a009j.jpg" alt="The reset button looks like two blue arrows" /></div> ).  <br /><br />
</li><li>In the menu at the top, click <strong><code>Add</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Name" box, enter a meaningful name for the form.  

<p>Choose the name carefully; be sure to choose a name that indicates
the specific use of this form. After the form has been added to the
site or published globally, its name will be visible in Resources to
all site participants (or if published globally, to all participants
of all sites in the instance). Therefore, if the form is tailored to a
particular matrix cell or wizard page, a generic name such as
Reflection is misleading and makes the form seem appropriate for
general use when, in fact, it is not. Use a generic name for a form
only if the fields, field names, and instructions in it make the form
suitable for use in a wide variety of situations.</p>

</li><li>Click <strong><code>Select Schema File</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Find the XSD file you uploaded in step 1 and, next to its name,
click <strong><code>Select</code></strong>.  <br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong> to return to the Add Form screen. 
<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Instruction" box, enter instructions to help the
participant complete the form.  Use the icons and drop-down menus to
format the text as appropriate.  <br /><br />
</li><li>If you developed an alternate form creation renderer (controlling
the data entry view) and/or form view renderer (controlling the
read-only view) for the XSD, use the <strong><code>Select XSL File</code></strong> links to
upload and select the XSL renderers.  <br /><br />
</li><li>To preview the form, click <strong><code>Preview</code></strong>.  Enter test data into
the preview version of the form and click <strong><code>Validate</code></strong> to ensure
the form works properly.  Then, click <strong><code>Return</code></strong> to go back to
the Add Form screen.  <br /><br />
</li><li>To complete the process, click <strong><code>Add Form</code></strong>. The new form is
added to the list in an unpublished state.</li></ol>

<h3>Previewing a form</h3>

<p>Before adding a form to a matrix cell, wizard page, or portfolio
template, you can preview the form to make sure it's appropriate for
your intended purpose. You have two options:</p>

<h4>Method one</h4>

<p>This method works for forms listed in the Forms tool, including hidden
forms. However, it cannot be used to preview global forms, i.e., forms
that the administrator has made available to all users.</p>

<ol><li>Go to the worksite containing the form you wish to preview. From
the menubar, click <strong><code>Forms</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Manage Forms page, for the form you wish to preview, click
<strong><code>Edit</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Edit Form page, click <strong><code>Preview</code></strong>. An empty version of
the form will appear.  <br /><br />
</li><li>To test the form, enter sample data in each field and click
<strong><code>Validate</code></strong>. To return to the Edit Form page, click <strong><code>Return</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Save Changes</code></strong> or <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to return to the
Manage Forms page.</li></ol>


<h4>Method two</h4> 

<p>This method works for site-specific and global forms, but cannot be
used to preview hidden forms.</p>

<ol><li>Go to My Workspace. In the menubar, click <strong><code>Resources</code></strong> to
open the Resources tool.  <br /><br />
</li><li>Open the <strong><code>Add</code></strong> menu next to any folder, and choose <strong><code>New
Form Item</code></strong>.  <br /><br />
</li><li>All of the forms to which you have access (except hidden forms)
will be listed on the Select a Form page. Forms are organized into
groups by site (the site in which the form resides), and then
alphabetically by form name. Select the form you wish to preview, and
click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>. An empty version of the form will appear.
<br /><br />
</li><li>To test the form, enter sample data in each field and click
<strong><code>Continue</code></strong>. The Edit Details screen for the form will be
displayed. Otherwise, click <strong><code>Back</code></strong> to return to the list and
preview another form, or <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to return to Resources in My
Workspace.  <br /><br />
</li><li>Give the completed form an appropriate name, complete the Edit
Details screen, and click <strong><code>Finish</code></strong>. The Resources folder for My
Workspace will be displayed.  <br /><br />
</li><li>Click the name of the completed form to review its
content; remove the completed form if it is no longer needed.
</li></ol>
