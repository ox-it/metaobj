<h2>Forms: Overview</h2>
<p>Forms are online structures that allow you to collect and store
data. They are the electronic counterparts of paper forms, such as
those you fill out to submit applications, complete surveys, and so
forth.</p>

<p>Each form consists of a name, instructions to the user, and a set of
input fields or boxes with field names. Both the instructions and the
field names guide site participants in completing the form
appropriately.  The form itself, in the Forms tool, is a structure
comprising places for data.  When an instructor or other user in the
role of CIG Coordinator creates and publishes a new form, the form is
ready for data entry.  When the form is filled out, the completed form
data is stored in Resources. If the form was filled out in the process
of completing a matrix cell or wizard page, the data will be stored in
the <code>Portfolio Interactions</code> folder in the participant's <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My
Workspace</a> Resources. If the form was completed via the Resources tool,
it will most often be stored in the participant's main My Workspace
Resources folder.</p>

<p>Forms allow you to collect, store, and display information in wizards,
matrices, and portfolios. These forms can serve a variety of
purposes. For example, you may use forms to collect routine
information, such as contact information and educational or work
history. You may also use forms to prompt users to document their
learning or provide metadata for work they have completed. Other forms
may be designed to guide users in documenting the details of a
teaching experience, restating a particular learning outcome in their
own words, or describing an internship experience. Some forms are
specifically dedicated to guide users to reflect upon their learning,
skills, course work, or other experiences. Still other forms can be
used to collect feedback or evaluation from instructors or peers on
the user's work.</p>

<p>In wizards and matrices, different forms can be presented to users in
different roles:</p>

<ul><li>Site participants may be asked to fill out forms to provide
background information, document work on projects, describe courses,
reflect on co-curricular experiences, or organize thoughts about
learning outcomes. These users fill out and save one or more completed
forms as they work in each wizard page and matrix cell.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Site participants may also be asked to reflect upon the items they
have included in the matrix cell or wizard page by commenting on the
origin of the items, the process of creating them, their strengths and
weaknesses, what they learned, and what might be some next steps for
improving them.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Reviewers and evaluators may use forms to provide feedback on a
site participant's work. These forms collect formative feedback (from
reviewers) and summative feedback (from evaluators) on the work
demonstrated in individual wizard pages and matrix cells or on the
work in the matrix or wizard as a whole. Forms for summative feedback
can include an evaluation scale or an elementary or full-fledged
clickable rubric with descriptors for the levels of each criterion.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Note to participants:</strong> You will not normally use (or
even see) the Forms tool in your portfolio sites.  That work has been
done before you start.  You will follow the workflow given by your
instructors, during which you will fill out and save one or more
forms, and use the completed forms (sometimes called form instances)
as elements in the portfolio that you build.</p>

<h3>For CIG Coordinators: Completed forms and data types</h3>

<p>Within a particular wizard, matrix, or portfolio, you may specify that
some forms are required, some forms can be completed only once, and
some forms need not be completed at all if they are not appropriate.</p>

<p>Other forms can and should be used repeatedly to collect multiple
versions of the same type of data in several completed instances of
the same form. So, a student may complete and save a contact
information form many times to capture information about his or her
home, work, school, summer, research, study abroad, and/or parents'
locations. When working with portfolios, the student can include any
or all of these different completed form instances in one or more
portfolios and/or one or more versions of a specific portfolio.</p>

<p>The instructions, fields, and field names in forms vary, depending on
the information the form is designed to collect. Fields may also be as
small or large as the creator of the form deems necessary.</p>

<p>Forms can contain many fields and types of data. The supported data
types are shown in this table.</p>

<table class="kbtable" cellpadding="4"><col /><col /><tr valign="top"><th align="left" class="kbtd">Data Type</th><th align="left" class="kbtd">Examples
</th></tr><tr valign="top"><td align="left" class="kbtd">String</td><td align="left" class="kbtd">First name, street address, insights gained, feedback
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td align="left" class="kbtd">Date</td><td align="left" class="kbtd">Birth date, date of certification, creation date
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td align="left" class="kbtd">Integer</td><td align="left" class="kbtd">Current age, Social Security number, years at current address
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td align="left" class="kbtd">Decimal</td><td align="left" class="kbtd">GPA, mathematical results
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td align="left" class="kbtd">Boolean </td><td align="left" class="kbtd">A true/false or yes/no answer to a question
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td align="left" class="kbtd">File (anyURI)</td><td align="left" class="kbtd">File attachment demonstrating one's ability
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td align="left" class="kbtd">Complex </td><td align="left" class="kbtd">A group of fields of the same or mixed data types
</td></tr></table>

<p>Each field in the form uses a specific data type.  Fields can be
configured to validate the user's input (for example, to ensure that
the numeric value for a date falls within a plausible range).  Also,
the form creator can specify whether a field is optional or required
and whether the field may be repeated (filled out more than once).</p>

<p>Available field types include text, rich text, date, selection (radio
buttons for less than five options, drop-down menu for five or more),
group, file (for attachments), and Boolean (check boxes).</p>

<p>Forms may be published globally (that is, for use in all sites in the
Sakai instance) or locally (for use in the current site only). Most
forms are created for specific sites. However, if you
create a form that has general applicability, you may recommend that
it be published globally. Only a system administrator can publish a
form globally (in response to your recommendation).</p>

<p>A portfolio template may display all fields from a form included in
the template, or only selected fields. The same form (and some or all
of its fields) may be used in multiple portfolio templates, wizards,
and matrices.</p>
